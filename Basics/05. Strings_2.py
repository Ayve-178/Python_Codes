#What if we want to print 'Ayve's Laptop'?
#print('Ayve's Laptop')
#But this code will give you an error.
print("Ayve's Laptop")
#It will work. But what if we want to use single quotes.
print('Ayve\'s Laptop')
# \ considers the next character as a special character. So it doesn't give any error.

#Suppose we want to print Ayve 3 times.
print("AyveAyveAyve")
print("Ayve"+"Ayve"+"Ayve")
print(3*"Ayve")

#what if a string contains a special character as a part of the string?
print('c:\docs\new folder')
#Here \n will give you a new line. But we don't want that.
print(r'c:\docs\new folder')
#r means raw. It is used to keep the raw string unchanged. r stops the role of a special character.


#Happy Coding! ^_^
